## Case Conversion
This is a port of [Davis Clark's](https://github.com/jdc0589) [Case Conversion Sublime Plugin](https://github.com/jdc0589/CaseConversion) to a simple python package. I couldn't find any other python packages on PyPi at the time (Feb 2016) that could seemlessly convert from any case to any other case, but I'd been using this plugin which has been working exactly like the python package I wanted. So I ripped just the python parts of the plugin into this useful python package. All credit goes to [Davis Clark's](https://github.com/jdc0589) and the contributers to that plugin (Scott Bessler, Curtis Gibby, Matt Morrison).
